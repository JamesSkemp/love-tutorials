Various tutorials with the [LÖVE framework](https://love2d.org/).

## Personal Development Environment

At this time I'm using [Notepad++ to develop in Lua](https://love2d.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B), with the recommended auto-completion plugin.

I've also added a new Run command.

1. Select **Run** and then **Run...** from the menu.
2. Enter the command `"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"` in the prompt and press the **Save...** button.
	- This is the command I need to run on my 64-bit Windows 10 device.
